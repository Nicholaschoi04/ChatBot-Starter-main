# Chatbot

This repository contains the implementation of a sophisticated chatbot using Microsoft DialoGPT integrated with Flask, a Python web framework. The project showcases a web application that communicates with users through a chat interface, combining advanced NLP (Natural Language Processing) capabilities with web development technologies.

## Overview

- **Language Model**: Leverages Microsoft DialoGPT, a pre-trained language model known for generating human-like text responses.
- **Backend**: Integrates DialoGPT with Flask to handle backend functionalities, including processing user inputs and generating responses.
- **Frontend**: Uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an engaging and interactive user interface. 
- **HTTP Requests**: Employs jQuery for streamlined handling of HTTP requests to and from the Flask server.

## Features
